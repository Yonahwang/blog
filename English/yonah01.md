## On your time
New York is 3 hours ahead of California,   
but it does not make California slow.   
Someone graduated at the age of 22,   
but waited 5 years before securing a good job!   
Someone became a CEO at 25,   
and died at 50.   
While another became a CEO at 50,   
and lived to 90 years.   
Someone is still single,   
while someone else got married.    
Obama retires at 55,   
but Trump starts at 70.   
Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.   

People around you might seem to go ahead of you,
some might seem to be behind you.   
But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.   
Don’t envy them or mock them.   
They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!
Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.
So, RELAX.   
You’re not LATE.
You’re not EARLY.
You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.   
Don’t let anyone rush you with their time lines.  
Because as Einstein said, “ Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that’s counted truly counts.”    
因为爱因斯坦曾经说过：并不是每一件算的出来的事，都有意义，也不是每一件有意义的事，都能够被算出来。   
你只管努力，上帝自有安排。只要你肯努力，最坏的结果也不过是大器晚成。享受现在的生活，并感激它。不要抱怨
